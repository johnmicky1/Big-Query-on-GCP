This introduces us to three applications commonly used in google cloud, that is Cloud Marketplace, Compute Engine and Google Kubernetes Engine.
 
 # Cloud Marketplace
      Marketplace provides a way to launch common software packages and stacks on Google Compute Engine with just a few clicks. Many common web    frameworks, databases, CMSs, and CRMs are supported. This is one of the fastest ways to get up and running on Google Cloud Platform.
      
 # Compute Engine
       Computing Engine is an infrastructure as a service allowing users to:
           .create and run virtual machines on Google infrastructure.
 Compute Engine offers scale, performance, and value that lets you easily launch large compute clusters on Google's infrastructure.
 
 # Google Kubernetes Engine
        This is a platform as a service open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
        
**Without** wating time, lets dived to each in detail and see how these applications are practically deployed in the Google Cloud Enviroment.
